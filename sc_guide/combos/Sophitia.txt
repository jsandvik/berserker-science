4[A] AS: B :4 | | (obv other variations will do less, use B followup for wallsplat/ringout. Followup is inconsistent on some chars due to how they but you can also do 2BK for ringout/wallsplat* (can't resplat/launch here so combo damage is smaller, but still significant.))

3B > wrB+K CE 75 builds more meter than going straight into CE, harder. not really worth it imo but good to know.
